# 🌍 IoT Air Quality & Pollution Monitoring Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

The **IoT Air Quality & Pollution Monitoring Dashboard** is an environmental monitoring system designed to track air quality, temperature, and humidity in real time. The project combines IoT concepts, cloud analytics, data visualization, and environmental monitoring to provide actionable insights into air pollution levels.

The system uses an ESP32-based architecture (simulated in Wokwi), a DHT22 sensor for temperature and humidity monitoring, and a simulated MQ135 air quality sensor. Data is logged locally, visualized through Python dashboards, and uploaded to ThingSpeak for cloud-based monitoring and analytics.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Monitor environmental conditions in real time.
* Classify air quality into meaningful categories.
* Generate alerts for unsafe pollution levels.
* Store sensor readings for analysis.
* Visualize trends using charts and dashboards.
* Upload sensor data to the cloud using ThingSpeak.

## 📊 AQI Classification

| AQI Value | Status    |
| --------- | --------- |
| 0 – 100   | GOOD      |
| 101 – 200 | MODERATE  |
| 201 – 350 | POOR      |
| 351+      | HAZARDOUS |

---

## 🔔 Alert Logic

| Status    | Alert  |
| --------- | ------ |
| GOOD      | Normal |
| MODERATE  | Normal |
| POOR      | Alert  |
| HAZARDOUS | Alert  |

When pollution reaches unsafe levels:

* LED turns ON
* Buzzer activates
* Alert is generated
* Cloud dashboard is updated

---

## ☁️ ThingSpeak Integration

The project uploads environmental data to ThingSpeak Cloud for remote monitoring.
